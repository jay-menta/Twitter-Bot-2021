# Twitter-Bot-2021
Twitter Automation Tool to increase impressions.

*Running the code may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access.
Setting the action speed slow makes it very hard for Twitter to detect that you're using a bot. 
However, be careful with number of interactions, because even a human can be banned for violating limits if you follow or retweets too much.
See also "Twitter-Bot-Detection-Rules.txt" for reference.
